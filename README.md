# PicoADK v2

We are currently working on the PicoADK v2 - the successor to the PicoADK v1. It is powered by the RP2350A Cortex-M33 MCU, which has floating point support along other features.
Explore the RP235x branches of this repo for work-in-progress.

For firmware progress check [the RP235x branch](https://github.com/DatanoiseTV/PicoADK-Firmware-Template/tree/RP235x)

- **Powerful MCU**: Equipped with a Raspberry Pi RP2350A MCU (Dual Core 150MHz with overclocking capability, Hazard3 RISC-V or Cortex-M33, software selectable) for fast computing.
- **Lot of Storage**: 4 MB QSPI Flash for your Code and Data.
- **Expandable Memory**: Optional 8MB QSPI PSRAM for applications which need more RAM (e.g., long delays).
- **Connectivity**: QUIIC / I2C Connector.
- **Debugging Features**: SWD Debug Port.
- **Storage Options**: TF-Card (Micro) on the bottom of the PCB (SPI or SDIO 4-bit Mode capable).
- **MIDI In Circuit** with Optocoupler.
- **Presoldered Pin Headers**.
- **Power LED**.
- **User LED**.
- **Type-C for Programming and User Applications**.
- **5-pin USB pins** (e.g., for USB Host).
- **I2S Pins exposed on the headers**, to allow for connecting an ADC.


# PicoADK - Audio Development Kit Firmware

This boilerplate template allows you to create standalone synthesizers, noise boxes, sample players, ..

## Template example code notes

The example code is a simple monophonic synthesizer which can be controlled via USB MIDI or can play a
randomly generated melody. It requires you to solder 4 Potentiometers to the ADC0-ADC3 pins, which control
wavefolding, envelope amount, filter frequency and resonance.

## Repository structure
* C code is located in the src folder and contains all the low-level funtionality for the firmware incl. USB MIDI handling and dealing with the Audio DAC.
* Includes for the C code are located in the include folder.
* The Vult DSP code is located in the vultsrc folder.
* The includes for Vult are located in lib/vult/examples. These provide some oscillator, filter and envelope implementation along others.

## Compiling using PicoADK Docker Image (easy)

*** Currently broken, will be fixed soon. ***

### Using the script

Just execute **./build-firmware-docker.sh** in the project folder.

### Manually
1. git clone --recursive https://github.com/DatanoiseTV/PicoADK-Firmware-Template.git
2. cd PicoADK-Firmware-Template
3. Enter the following command in your project directory:

```bash
docker run --rm -u $(id -u):$(id -g)  -v $PWD:/project -w /project datanoisetv/picoadk-dev:latest build-firmware.sh
```
## Prerequisites (manual)

1. Install the Pico-SDK. You can find a guide at https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf
2. Install the [Vult](https://github.com/vult-dsp/vult/) compiler: `sudo npm install vult -g`
3. (Optional) Install Ninja - apt install ninja

## Compiling the firmware (manual)
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/DatanoiseTV/PicoADK-FreeRTOS-Template picoadk-template
cd picoadk-template
export PICO_SDK_FETCH_FROM_GIT=1
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. (optionally add -GNinja)
make (or ninja when you have used -GNinja)
```
Now you can find a main.uf2 in the build folder, which is your firmware.

## Copying the Firmware to the PicoADK

Plug in the PicoADK USB Type-C while holding the **BOOT** button **or** hold **BOOT** and press the reset button quickly.
After that, a **RPI-RP2** disk volume will appear. Simply drag and drop the UF2 file to this drive and the PicoADK will
reboot after a moment, the drive will disappear and your firmware will be running.

## More information

Please check the [Pico Getting Started Guide](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf) on how to install the toolchain and required libraries for your OS.

## Development

The pipeline will trigger a full build on Push or Pull Request.

### Releasing

The pipeline will trigger a new release build on following tagging scheme:

```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

# Hardware
